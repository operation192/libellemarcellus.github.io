    <p>Libelle Marcellus <span class="bold">(pronounced as: Lee-bell Mar-cell-us)</span> is a versatile author with a passion for storytelling across every genre. From a young age, Libelle Marcellus has been creating books and stories, starting at just five years old, when she was in kindergarten. This early spark for writing has grown into a lifelong dedication to the craft. Each book is a product of her imagination and hard workâ€”no ghostwriters, just genuine passion and original ideas. Whether crafting heartfelt dramas, thrilling mysteries, or fantastical adventures, she thrives on pushing creative boundaries and bringing fresh perspectives to readers of all kinds.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p>Being born in Boston, Massachusetts, it is somewhat ironic that she was born in a proud port city surrounded by water, since she later chose to pursue a career in the maritime industry as a merchant mariner.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Outside of writing, Libelle holds a ServSafe Manager certification and is certified in CPR. She has a passion for cooking, especially watching people enjoy the meals she prepares. When sheâ€™s not writing, she spends her time creating music using the programming language called Python, building apps and websites, and even programmed this author website herself! Her work is fueled by creativity and the variety of interests that shape her multifaceted life.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Libelle also taught herself how to speak French and currently speaks at a B1 level. <b>"Je trouve que le franÃ§ais est une belle langue avec beaucoup de culture et dâ€™histoire. Aussi, je voulais le parler avec les membres de ma famille parce quâ€™ils parlent franÃ§ais."</b> (I find French to be a beautiful language with a lot of culture and history. I also wanted to speak it with my family members because they speak French.)</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>As a woman in STEM, Libelle learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in high school and now applies those skills to web development and app creation. She enjoys bringing digital ideas to life through coding, whether itâ€™s websites, apps, or interactive projects.</p>
