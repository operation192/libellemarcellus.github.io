        <h2>My Advice For New Authors</h2>

        <p>There are three major paths to publishing a book: <b>traditional publishing, hybrid publishing, and self-publishing.</b> And trust me, I’ve got opinions on all of them.</p>

        <h2>Traditional Publishing</h2>
        
        <p>Traditional publishing is what most people picture when they think of releasing a book: an author lands a deal with a publishing house, and from there, the company handles everything—editing, production, distribution, and marketing. The author typically receives an advance and royalties based on book sales. Sounds great, right?</p>

        <p>But here’s the part no one really tells you: the publishing house takes a significant share of the royalties. Since they’re doing all the heavy lifting on the backend, most of the profits go to them, not you. In traditional publishing, authors typically receive 5%-15% royalties on print book sales, with ebook royalties often around 25%. On top of that, once you sign the deal, they get the final say on your book. That means your story, your characters, and your message can be altered to fit what they think will sell.</p>

        <p> Publishers usually work with the author when making changes, but if there’s a disagreement, they often have the final word. You might have a clear vision for your work, but they’re not obligated to honor it.
        And to be honest, traditional publishing houses are slowly becoming a thing of the past. <b>Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Hachette, and Simon & Schuster are the “Big Five” that dominate the landscape—and as you can imagine, they’re extremely selective. </b>There are still mid-size and small presses out there, but these days, most are looking for authors who already have a massive platform—millions of followers or at least 10,000 book sales.</p>

        <p>So even if you’re okay with giving up creative control and the majority of your earnings, chances are, you won’t meet their expectations unless you’ve already “made it.”
        That brings me to self-publishing, which is the route I took.</p>

        <h2>Self-Publishing</h2>
        
        <p>I went about self-publishing through an online distributor called <b>Draft2Digital.</b> They helped me bring my dreams to life and put my work out into the world. And just to be clear—I’m not being sponsored or paid to say this. I’m saying it because it’s simply the truth.</p>

        <p>You don’t need to pay anything to get started with Draft2Digital. They don’t ask for any shady fees or make you jump through hoops. All you need is an email and a password to sign up, and you can start publishing your books the same day.</p>

        <p> Draft2Digital made me realize that self-publishing isn’t nearly as hard as I once anticipated it to be. All it takes is a manuscript (which is just your book in written form), an editor, and a tall-rectangle image for your cover. And yes, you should hire an editor before you publish. But even if you’re not a designer or artist, there are thousands of templates out there to help you create a professional-looking book cover. I recommend <b>Canva</b> and <b>Placeit</b>—both are great tools for cover design.</p>
        
        <p>What makes Draft2Digital so powerful is that they distribute your book to major online retailers like Kobo, Apple Books, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble. At the time of writing this article for my blog post, I haven’t made a lot of money from my books yet, but that doesn’t bother me. Draft2Digital doesn’t take a dime unless you get paid. That kind of setup felt fair and empowering.</p>

        <p>Now I will say—when you self-publish, everything is up to you: the marketing, the promotion, the editing, the designing… all of it. But if you’re truly in love with writing as an art, not just as a business, you’ll start to enjoy the process. You’ll learn. You’ll grow. You’ll own it.</p>

        <p>I’m sure Draft2Digital isn’t the only distributor that sends your books to major retailers, but in my opinion, they’re doing it right. Self-publishing should be simple. It should be enjoyable. It shouldn’t cost money just to share your story with the world. That was never how it was supposed to be.</p>

        <p>And that, right there, is why I’ve developed a particular grudge against hybrid publishing agencies.</p>

        <h2>Hybrid Publishing</h2>
        
        <p>Hybrid publishing agencies sit somewhere between self-publishing and traditional publishing. In this setup, you present your manuscript to a company, and they work with you on editing, cover images (especially useful if you’re writing a children’s book or something highly visual), and distributing your work to online stores. Sounds like a decent middle ground, right? Well… It’s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>

        <p>Hybrid publishers can be highly problematic, especially for new authors who don’t yet understand the ins and outs of the publishing industry. These companies tend to be predatory, charging exorbitant fees for services that should either be more affordable or, in some cases, free. They're profit-driven, not author-focused. And the worst part? They share a lot of similarities with vanity presses.
          
          <b>So, what’s a vanity press?</b></p>
          
          
         
          
          <p>A vanity press is a publishing company that takes money from authors just for the privilege of having their book “published.” The process is more about giving authors the illusion of success than actually bringing quality work to the market. These presses often lack the rigorous editorial standards or quality control that traditional publishers have, publishing pretty much anything as long as the author is willing to pay. Vanity presses do not go through a selective process - meaning they will accept any manuscript from an author as long as the author is willing to pay for it.</p>

          <p>While hybrid publishers don’t fully align with vanity presses, they still lack the essential benefits that traditional publishing offers. Traditional publishers are selective when it comes to selecting work from authors but at least they bring industry connections, marketing expertise, and a distribution network—things hybrid publishers simply don’t provide in the same way.</p>

          <p>Now, my biggest gripe with hybrid publishers? They charge authors to publish their work. Let that sink in. You should never have to pay to get your thoughts, ideas, characters, plots, or storylines into the world. However, hybrid publishers profit off authors just looking for a way in. Once you’ve paid them for their services, guess what? They won’t help you market your book. And marketing? That’s the hardest, most important part of publishing and profiting off of your work. They already got their cut, and now it’s your problem to figure out how to sell your book.</p>

          <p>However, I do not judge new artists for falling down the path of hybrid publishers because I almost fell down that road myself. When I was trying to upload my first book - What Society Wants For Itself - it all felt like a world far away. Now, I'm the leader of that same world I was lost in.</p>

          <h2>Verdict</h2>

          <p>My advice for new authors is simple: start with self-publishing and build from there. Why? Because it gives you full control over your work and your image. You won’t have to spend money just to share your thoughts with the world, and it allows you to tap into your entrepreneurial spirit. Self-publishing empowers you to make your own decisions, keep all the profits, and truly own your journey as an author.
