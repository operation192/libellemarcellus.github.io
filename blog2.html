        <h2>Coding My Own Author Website</h2>

        <p>Yup! You read the title correctly.
          I coded this very website you're seeing — all by myself. And I’m more than happy to share how I brought all this greatness to life.</p>

        <h2>How did I do it?</h2>

        <p>I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are all front-end languages used to build websites. I know not everyone is deep in the coding world like I am, so let me break it down a bit:</p>
        

        <div class="centered-list-container">
          <ul class="centered-list">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the backbone of any website. Think of it like the skeleton of a human body — it gives structure and holds everything in place. HTML tells the browser what each part of the webpage is: headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more. Without HTML, you wouldn't see any content at all — just a blank screen.
              </li>
            
              <li>
                <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is what styles the website and brings it to life visually. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and even animations. If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the outfit, hairstyle, and overall appearance. It makes your website look nice and feel cohesive, helping you set the mood and tone for your visitors.
              </li>
            
              <li>
                <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the interactive brain behind the scenes. It adds behavior and dynamic features to a website — like dropdown menus, image sliders, live form validation, and more. JavaScript lets your website respond to user actions in real time, making it feel more alive and responsive. Without JavaScript, a website would just sit there — pretty, but static.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
          </ul>
        </div>
        

    
        
        <h2>Why did I do it?</h2>

        <p>The answer is simple: to save money — but also because I genuinely enjoy coding and building websites.

          When I started researching hybrid publishing companies (which I explain more in this <a href ="blog1.html" target="_blank">post)</a>, I saw that many of them offered website design... for a price. That’s when it hit me: Wait, I already know how to do this. Why pay someone else?
          
          So I rolled up my sleeves, opened my code editor, and built this site myself — from scratch. </p>

        <p> I used Visual Studio Code, which is a code editor, to get started. I developed the entire website there from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once I was done building everything, I used GitHub Pages to publish my author website. I really like GitHub Pages because it let me publish my site for free — no hosting fees, no hidden costs.</p>

         <p> After developing a website (whether you build it from scratch like I did or use something like Wix with templates), you’ll need a domain name to actually make it live and accessible to the world. The domain is basically the name of your website — it’s what people will type into a search engine or URL bar to find your site.</p>
          
         <p> I chose a .com domain because it’s professional, trusted, and easy to remember. Yes, there are free domain options out there, but they usually come with limits and strange endings like .xyz or .11b. Those just don’t look as polished — and they can even come off as spammy. So, investing in a good domain was important to me. </p>

        <h2> Why I Chose A .com Domain (And Why You Should Too) </h2>

        <p>When building my author website, I had a lot of choices for my domain name. I could’ve gone with something like .xyz, .site, or even .11b (yeah... those exist). But I chose .com — and here’s why:</p>

  

        <div class="centered-list-container">
          <ol class="centered-list">
            <ol>
            <li> <strong>.com is trusted.</strong>
              Most people automatically type .com when they’re looking up a website. It’s been around the longest, and because of that, it feels legit and reliable.
            </li>

            <li><strong>It’s easier to remember.</strong>
              Ever tried remembering a weird domain like coolauthor.11b? Exactly. .com just rolls off the tongue — and that makes it easier for people to remember and come back to your site.
            </li>
            <li><strong>It looks professional.</strong>
              If you want to look like a serious author, creator, or business owner, a .com domain gives off that professional energy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Some other endings can look spammy.</strong>
              While not all unusual domain endings are bad, many people associate them with scammy or low-quality sites.
            </li>
            <li><strong>It holds value.</strong>
              If you ever want to grow your brand or even sell your domain name one day, .com domains are much more valuable than those uncommon extensions.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
    
        </div>

        <p>In conclusion, developing my own author website has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Not only did I save money by doing it myself, but I also had the opportunity to sharpen and expand my programming skills. The process allowed me to put my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to good use, while also giving me a sense of pride in building something that represents my work and brand. It was both a creative and technical challenge that I’m excited to continue developing in the future.</p>
